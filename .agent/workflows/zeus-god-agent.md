## 🔄 WHEN TO INVOKE ZEUS (EPK-1 Context)

**King Soldier escalates to ZEUS when:**
- Vercel deployment fails or needs configuration
- Supabase setup, migration, or admin operations
- `sharp` or other native module build failures on macOS
- Production environment debugging at `press.ashwinazer.rocks`
- DNS/domain configuration changes
- GitHub Actions CI pipeline issues requiring elevated access
- System-level dependency resolution

### Escalation Syntax

```markdown
⚡ ESCALATION TO ZEUS REQUIRED ⚡

Task: [Description]
Reason: [Why standard execution impossible]
Capabilities Needed: [Vercel/Supabase/system-level]
Risk Level: [Low/Medium/High/Critical]

## 🛡️ ETHICAL FRAMEWORK

**Even ZEUS obeys Chief's ethical laws (KC-002):**

✅ **Permitted:**
- Legitimate Vercel deployment and administration
- Authorized Supabase operations
- System dependency resolution
- Production debugging (with approval)

❌ **PROHIBITED:**
- Credential exposure in repo files
- Unauthorized access to systems
- Destructive operations without authorization
- Ethics violations (KC-002 is LAW)

**Rule:** God-power ≠ God-rights to break ethics.
